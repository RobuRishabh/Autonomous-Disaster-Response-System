# Autonomous Disaster Response System
 This project delves into the growing significance of
mobile robots in disaster response over the past two decades. By
enhancing situational awareness and control in potentially dangerous
environment (such as the interior of a collapsed building), these
robots prove invaluable to emergency response teams. One major
application of mobile robots is reconnaissance, where they are deployed
to explore hazardous environments and identify potential threats and
survivors (victims). The data gathered by mobile robots facilitates the
formulation of effective action plans that minimize risks to emergency
personnel.
