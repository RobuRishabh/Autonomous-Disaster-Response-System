# Autonomous Disaster Response System
 This project involves designing and implementing a complete autonomous system for performing reconnaissance in a simulated disaster environment. The system must generate a complete map of the environment and locate any victims present in the environment using AprilTags. The environment is represented using an occupancy grid map. The system can be constructed using any off-the-shelf components such as the gmapping package for building occupancy grid maps, the move base package from the ROS navigation stack for generating and following motion plans, and/or a frontier exploration package such as explore lite. The project includes modifying explore lite to address the goal of searching for victims and implementing approaches for ensuring accurate pose estimation of each detected AprilTag. The deliverables include ROS nodes, launch files, a group report, and a short demonstration video of the turtlebot performing the task.
